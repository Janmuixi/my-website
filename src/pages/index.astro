    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I am a Software Engineer with experience across the JavaScript
      ecosystem, including a wide range of frameworks and libraries. I have
      invested time in understanding the underlying mechanisms that make
      JavaScript work in browsers and on servers.
      <br />
      <br />
      Since joining Flanks, my interest in finance and how calculations are
      performed has grown significantly. That curiosity led me to become
      proficient in other languages like Python and to deepen my understanding
      of different data structures.
      <br />
      <br />
      I consider myself a very curious person who enjoys understanding why
      things work the way they do. Recently, I've been exploring technologies
      related to AI agents and some low-level programming languages like Zig.
